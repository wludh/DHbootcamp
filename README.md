## Fall 2021

### September 29, 2021 - What is DH anyway?
* In our first session, we'll spend some time unpacking the many definitions of
Digital Humanities.
* In preparation, take a look a [A Short Guide to the Digital_Humanities](https://jeffreyschnapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/D_H_ShortGuide.pdf) and be prepared to talk about the place of DH in your own discipline. 
* You might also want to peruse the [Debates in Digital Humanities](https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/projects/debates-in-the-digital-humanities) and see what strikes your fancy. There are three editions and I always recommend checking out [Bethany Nowviskie](https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-f2acf72c-a469-49d8-be35-67f9ac1e3a60/section/3a53cbc1-5eee-421a-a4f6-82bb5dfb1c17#ch37) and [Roopika Risam](https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled/section/4316ff92-bad0-45e8-8f09-90f493c6f564#ch29).
* Agenda:
  * Introductions + icebreaker
  * Overview of the series
  * Discussion
* Questions:
  * What were your perceptions of DH in grad school? Why did you want to join this bootcamp? How do you see DH fitting into your teaching and research?
  * What are your reactions to the Short Guide to DH? Was anything new? Unexpected? What parts seem difficult for you and your situation?
  * What resonated with you from Debates in DH? 
  * How does your discipline react or incorporate DH? How does that affect your own approach?
